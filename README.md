# ULuvSonic

An experimental 2D Sonic Engine written in LOVE2D

# Set up

first of all, download love from https://love2d.org (but you already have it, right?? RIGHT???
next, download the source code of the project, and you're good to go!

# Building

To build the project/fangame into a .love file, Select every file in the project folder, then compress it into an archive (This will most likely be a .zip file.) Then, rename the file to <gamename>.love and replace the extension. It is now runnable with LOVE! there is probably some utility out there that will turn it into an EXE file but that's out of our scope ;)
